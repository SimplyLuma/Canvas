"""Asking the system for a file (v71 "File picker (system)").

The picker is the system's, not the application's: Filer's chooser, reached
through the file chooser portal, the same one every app gets. On a phone it
opens full screen over the app that asked, with who is asking and for what
above the place's crumbs ("Photos · Add photos", the app's icon), and a bar of
two rows (where you're looking, Search and Grid/List; then Cancel and Open
"name", Choose "folder", or a name field with Save). Cancel or a pick returns
to the app, which says what happened in its own toast.

An application never builds its own picker. It says what it is asking for, in
the words v71 uses, and the kit turns that into the portal's request: the
title is the ask, the picker starts in the right place, shows the right kind
of file, and its key says what will happen.

    request = FileRequest("Add photos", start="pictures", show="images", many=True)
    ask_for_file(window, request, lambda files: files and add(files), toast=toasts.show)

    FileRequest("Save a copy", mode="save", start="documents", name="Launch notes copy.md")
    FileRequest("Add a folder", mode="folder", start="music")      # Tide's library folder

`toast`, when given, gets v71's outcome line ("Photos opened “x.jpg”",
"Saved “x” to Documents", "Added 3 photos" is the app's own to say instead:
pass `outcome=`). Nothing is said on Cancel.
